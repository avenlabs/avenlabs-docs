Data availability in blockchain technology refers to whether or not transaction data is available on-chain or off-chain.

If data is available on-chain, then each node has to store every piece of data related to every transaction. This can be costly for node operators as hardware and storage requirements are high. Moving data off-chain streamlines node architecture and operations.
