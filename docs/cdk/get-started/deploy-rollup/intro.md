## Overview and setting up

Implementing the full stack Polygon CDK zkRollup EVM-compatible network involves more than just running a node and the prover to validate batches and deploy smart contracts. In its entirety, it encompasses all these processes and more.

The common rollup actors are the sequencer, the aggregator, the synchroniser and the JSON RPC node. All these affect the L2 state.

Also, the aggregator uses the prover to avail verifiable proofs of sequenced batches. And the sequenced batches are composed of transactions taken from the pool database.

This highlights just a few main components. The rest of the components and those working in the background, are listed in the next subsection.

### Why you need Docker

The modular design of the CDK zkRollup EVM-compatible network allows for most components to be separately instantiated, and we therefore run each of these instances in a separate Docker container.

The below table enlists all the CDK zkRollup EVM-compatible components/services and their corresponding container-names.

Our CDK zkRollup deployment-guide provides CLI commands to automatically create these Docker containers.

| Component         | Container            | Brief\ Description                                           |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sequencer         | zkevm-sequencer      | Fetches txs from the pool DB, checks if valid, then puts valid ones into a batch. |
| Aggregator        | zkevm-aggregator     | Validates sequenced batches by generating verifiable zero-knowledge proofs. |

| JSON RPC          | zkevm-rpc            | An interface for interacting with the network. e.g., Metamask, Etherscan or Bridge. |
| State DB          | zkevm-state-db       | A database for permanently storing state data (apart from the Merkle tree). |
| Prover            | zkevm-prover-server  | Used by the aggregator to create zk-proofs. Runs on an external cloud server. |
| Pool DB           | zkevm-pool-db        | Stores txs from the RPC nodes, waiting to be put in a batch by the sequencer. |
| Executor          | zkevm-executor       | Executes all processes. Collects results’ metadata (state root, receipts, logs) |
| Etherman          | zkevm-eth-tx-manager | Implements methods for all interactions with the L1 network and smart contracts. |
| Bridge UI         | zkevm-bridge-ui      | User-interface for bridging ERC-20 tokens between L2 and L1 or another L2. |
| Bridge DB         | zkevm-bridge-db      | A database for storing bridge-related transactions data.     |
| Bridge service    | zkevm-bridge-service | A backend service enabling clients like the web UI to interact with bridge smart contracts. |
| zkEVM explorer    | zkevm-explorer-l2    | L2 network's block explorer. i.e., The zkRollup Etherscan [rxplorer](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com). |
| zkEVM explorer DB | zkevm-explorer-l2-db | Database for the L2 network's Block explorer. i.e., Where all the zkRollup Etherscan explorer queries are made. |
| Gas pricer        | zkevm-l2gaspricer    | Responsible for suggesting the gas price for the L2 network fees. |
| Goërli execution  | goerli-execution     | L1 node's execution layer.                                   |
| Goërli consensus  | goerli-consensus     | L1 node's consensus layer.                                   |

## Preliminary setup

Implementing the Polygon CDK zkRollup EVM-compatible network requires either a Linux machine or a virtual machine running Linux as a Guest OS.

Since the CDK zkRollup implementation involves running Docker containers, ensure that a Docker daemon is installed on your machine.

Here's how to get setup;

For Linux machines, install the Docker engine directly on the machine.

For other operating systems (MacOS, Windows), this is achieved in 4 steps, executed in the given sequential order;

- Install a hypervisor, e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Fusion (MacOS), VMware Workstation (Windows), VMware ESXi (Bare Metal Hypervisor).
- Setup a virtual machine, e.g., if you are using VirtualBox, which is open-source, Vagrant is the quickest way to automatically setup a virtual machine and also set up ssh private/public keys.
- Install Linux as Guest OS, preferably the latest version of Ubuntu Linux.
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

Search the internet for quick guides on creating virtual machines. Here's an example of a video on [how to create a Linux VM on a Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAd7FafXfJQ).

In order to run multiple Docker containers, an extra tool called `docker compose` needs to be [downloaded and installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/). As you will see, a YAML file is used for configuring all CDK zkRollup services.

!!!info
    One more thing, since the prover is resource-heavy, you will need to run its container externally. Access to cloud computing services such as AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean will be required.

### Prerequisites

Next, ensure that you have checked your system specs, and have at hand all the variables listed below.

#### Environment variables

You'll need the following items to begin:

- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` // Same as API Key in your Infura account
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`
- Public IP address
- L1 Goërli node RPC
- Goërli address with **0.5 GöETH**

See this guide here for [**setting up your own Goërli node**](setup-goerli-node.md).

#### Computing requirements

Keep in mind that the mainnet files you will be downloading are 70GB in size.

If the prover is the only container you will be running externally in a cloud, then it is preferable to have a minimum 300GB of storage in the primary machine.

Depending on the user's resources, the zkEVM network can be implemented with either the actual full prover or the mock prover.

The full prover is resource-intensive as it utilizes the exact same proving stack employed in the real and live CDK zkRollup network.

!!!info
    The full prover's system requirements are:

    - 96-core CPU
    - Minimum 768GB RAM

The mock prover is a dummy prover which simply adds a "Valid ✅" checkmark to every batch.

!!!info
    The mock prover, on the other hand, only requires:

    - 4-core CPU
    - 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)

As an example, the equivalent [AWS EC2s](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r6a/) for each of these two provers are as follows:

- `r6a.xlarge` for mock prover.
- `r6a.24xlarge` for full prover.

The initial free disk space requirement is minimal (<2TB), but you should monitor available space as the network is always adding more data.

Once all the layers are setup and all prerequisites are in place, you can proceed to the next step of this guide.
