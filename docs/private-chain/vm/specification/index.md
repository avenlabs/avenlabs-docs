In the following sections, we provide developer-focused documentation useful to those who want to develop on Miden VM or build compilers from higher-level languages to Miden VM.

This documentation consists of two high-level sections:

- [Miden assembly](./assembly/index.md) which provides a detailed description of Miden assembly language, which is the native language of Miden VM.
- [Miden standard library](./stdlib/index.md) which provides descriptions of all procedures available in Miden standard library.

For info on how to run programs on Miden VM, please refer to the [usage](../intro/usage.md) section in the introduction.
