Polygon Miden uses a novel, actor-based state model to allow users to prove their own state locally, achieving high throughput and privacy at the same time. Polygon Miden is a general purpose rollup where developers can write and deploy arbitrary smart contracts.

!!! warning
    - Miden is currently in development.
    - A public testnet for Polygon Miden is expected in Q1 2024.

Polygon Miden offers features and benefits that are not available on Ethereum. Developers are empowered to build high-throughput, private dApps.

- **Beyond EVM**: Build novel applications, i.e.,  on-chain order book exchanges, complex incomplete information games, compliant and private asset management apps
- **Local data**: Control your data with local data storage. In Polygon Miden, privacy is the cheaper option and—if you want—the network only tracks a commitment to your data
- **High throughput**: Build applications that can be used by many users at the same time. Client-side proving reduces the burden on the network and allows for parallel transaction execution
- **Safety**: Account asset storage, account abstraction, privacy, and smart contracts in Rust are less prone to bugs and less exposed to hackers
