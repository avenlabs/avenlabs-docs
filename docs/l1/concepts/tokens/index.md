The Tokens subsection focuses on the proposed Polygon PoS's native token POL and the soon to be replaced native token MATIC.

The POL subsection defines the POL token and continues to present, in a question-and-answer (Q&A) format, all the information that users need to know about the proposed transition.

The subsequent MATIC subsection defines what the MATIC token is, gives an example script to send MATIC tokens from one account to another, the three different ways to acquire MATIC tokens and finally how to obtain test MATIC tokens.
