 Welcome to the Polygon PoS how-to section. There is a number of how-to guides here to help you get started with common technical tasks. We hope you find them useful.

The section covers a number of tutorials on how to operate different types of Polygon PoS nodes, how to bridge assets from PoS to Ethereum and conversely, or send messages between L1 and L2 networks, and how to work with smart contracts.

Included in the section is an elaborate startup guide for users who wish to implement the Polygon DID, which is a three-part package consisting of an indentity-registrar, identity-resolver, and identity-registry-contract.
