This sub-subsection provides technical details on how to achieve `State transfer` and `State syncing`.

The `State transfer` sub-subsection provides details of all requirements, contracts and functions that will be called to execute a State transfer.

The subsequent `Bridging with FxPortal` sub-subsection contains a tutorial implementing State syncing using FxPortal, which is a powerful yet simple implementation of Polygon's State syncing mechanism relying on a centralized mapping of a party's tokens on one chain to their contract on the other.
