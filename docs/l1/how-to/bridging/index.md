This subsection contains guides on how to deploy bridge smart contracts to enable transfer of assets between the Polygon PoS and Ethereum, as well as setting up a communication channel between an L2 chain and an L1 network.

The subsection gives details on how to enable reading state data in the Polygon chain as though it is read in the Ethereum network. This is enabled through a process that involves deployment of a `Sender contract` and a `Receiver contract`, mapping the Sender with the Receiver, and finally sending and receiving data.

Sending data from Polygon to Ethereum is different from the converse, which is discussed above. The `MATIC to Ethereum` subsection outlines how to setup such a bridge, and provides a tutorial on how to achieve the transfer.

The L1-L2 communication sub-subsection discusses how to achieve `State transfer` and `State syncing`.
