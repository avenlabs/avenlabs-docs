This section contains specifications of other zkEVM features not covered in the Architecture section of this documentation.

First are the two novel languages: The zero-knowledge Assembly (zkASM) language which interprets the firmware of microprocessor-type state machines, and the Polynomial Identity Language (PIL) which is instrumental in enabling verification of state transitions.

Second are some of the differences between Polygon zkEVM and the EVM. These are differences in terms of opcodes, supported precompiled contracts, newly added features and other variances.
