!!!caution
    Check the list of potential risks associated with the use of Polygon zkEVM in the [Disclosures](../../troubleshooting/risk-disclosures.md) section.

Connect to either the Polygon zkEVM's mainnet or the testnet. 

Add the Polygon zkEVM network of your choice to your wallet by navigating to the add network input, and enter the respective network details as given in the below table:

| Network | RPC URL | ChainID | Block Explorer URL | Currency |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Polygon zkEVM | `https://zkevm-rpc.com` | `1101` | `https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/` | **ETH** |
| zkEVM Testnet | `https://rpc.public.zkevm-test.net` | `1442` | `https://testnet-zkevm.polygonscan.com` | **ETH** |

Once the wallet is connected, the next step is to bridge crypto assets from Ethereum to zkEVM.
For testnet purposes, you can use the zkEVM faucet to get testnet tokens.
